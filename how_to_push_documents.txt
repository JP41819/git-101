$ git commit

#If you prefer, instead of above which opens a text editor, insert message in the command line

$ git commit -m "insert message"

#If you did not export a text editor or insert message in the command line, exit editor by:
# 	pressing 'i' to enter text and save by pressing 'Esc' and ':wq' and 'Enter' to commit with message
# 	Press 'Esc' and ':q' to exit without commiting

#Connect to remote repository if you haven't already

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourUserNameHere/repository-name.git

$ git pull origin master

#now you can push your file to the remote repository

$ push origin master

#now check your online repository to check that it has worked.
